        <h2>A designer &amp; leader with 15+ years of experience helping push how we communicate forward.</h2>

        <p>Drawing from my love of minimalism and storytelling, I have a track record of creating aesthetically pleasing and provocative vision work to encourage companies to go further, and designing experiences that are as objective focused as they are a joy to use.</p>

        <p>As a leader, I advocate for the voice of customers and a high-craft approach, and aim to be a strong source of mentorship and optimism.</p>

        <p>Currently, I am a Principal Designer at <a href="http://loom.com">Loom</a>, where I help shape product strategy and design team quality while designing features that get us closer to our company goal of being the most convenient form of high-fidelity communication at work. Before Loom, I joined Twitter as an early member of the product design team and left after a vibrant career as a mentor, inventor, and leader, ten teams and nine years later.</p>

        <p>In addition to design, my happy place is outside biking on the endless mountain roads in Boulder, Colorado, or behind a science fiction or architecture book.</p>
